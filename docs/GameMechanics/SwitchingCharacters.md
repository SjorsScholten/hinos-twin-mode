# Game Mechanic: Switching Characters

The body of the player character can be controlled by multiple characters. The body will take the properties and behavior of the character that is in control. The characters that are not in control will float near the character.

The player can switch who is controlling the body. When prompt the character that is controlling the body, will leave the body and become a floating spirit. While the other character will take over the body.

During the switch the player body becomes vulnerable. Enemies can take advantage of this vulnerability.

The player should decide to swap based on the situation. It is for us to build and design those situations with gameplay.
