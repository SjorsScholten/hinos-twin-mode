# Project Twin Mode

The main mechanic of the game is that the player can switch between 2 characters.

The player Takes control of two characters who share a single body. The player can choose what character can control the body. Each character has unique abilities they can only use when controlling the body. The player will have to adapt by choosing the right character for the situation.

How can we make each character high in contrast, but compliment well together.
